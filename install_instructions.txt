Hello,

Welcome to Data Science Africa 2016.

We will be using the ipython notebook



===Step 1: Installation===
First we need to get this installed. I recommend you install the
anaconda distribution, this contains everything you'll need. It is
available for windows, linux and apple. We'll be using the python 3.4
version.

I've included anaconda for windows and for linux on this memory stick.
You can also download it from:

http://continuum.io/downloads

It's quite big. 

The installation should be quite straightforward.

Copy the install file to your computer, then:

In windows just run the Anaconda installer exe. 

In linux, in your terminal window type something like:
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

(depending on where you installed it).

You'll need to close the terminal once you're done.







===Step 2:Trying it out===
Once it's all installed, you need to start Jupyter (also called an
ipython notebook).

In windows you should be able to find a launcher for IPython Notebook
under Anaconda in the Start Menu.

In linux or OS X, open a terminal window, then type:
    ipython notebook
    
It might be best to do this in the directory where you installed 
Classification.ipynb.

A browser window should pop up with the notebook inside (you might have
to click on a link in the terminal if that doesn't happen).

Create a new notebook by (at the top right of the screen) clicking on
New, then on Python 3. This should create a new notebook

In the box, by "In []:", try typing:

print("Hello World")

Then press Shift-enter. This will run it (you can also press the little
> arrow in the toolbar).

You should be able to open the ipython notebook (called Classification)
if it's in the directory where you ran the ipython.

We'll be moving about the workshop, so ask us for help, if you get stuck.
